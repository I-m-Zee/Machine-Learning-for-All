Describe your machine learning project, in terms of the following:

What problem were you trying to solve?
What data did you collect?
What classes did you use to classify your data, and why they were chosen?
1. I was trying to classify the humans vs animals which means that in My problem, I want to distinguish between humans and animals.

2. I collected almost 25 images of different animals (Lion, Tiger, Cat, Horse, Cow etc) and same amount of images humans (Male, Female, Beggar, Artists etc).

3. I chose only two classes "Humans" and "Animals" because i only want to differentiate between humans and animals.

T​his part of the question is about evaluating your project, in terms of the following:

How well did your classifier work? Were you happy with the results? What was the overall percentage accuracy on test data?
D​escribe what types of images your models classifies well and which they classify badly.
Explain why you think it performed well or badly on the images you described in the last part. 
Were there problems with the classifier that you were able to solve? Describe your strategy for solving the problem 
1. Yes, my classifier work very well even i had tried some test cases of humans wearing face mask of animals. In my case the overall percentage accuracy on the test data was almost 99.99%.

2. My model classify all type of image very well even i had tried some test cases of humans wearing face mask of animals.

3. It performed well because i have given it a large data set of images during training. So, a well trained model also predict well and his overall performance will also increases.

4. No, there were no problems with the classifier. If it had, then i will need large set of data and train the model again and then test my data.
